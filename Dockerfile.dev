# 1. Use a base image with the full JDK and Gradle installed.
# The official Gradle image is great, or use Microsoft's specialized devcontainer image.
FROM eclipse-temurin:latest

# 2. Install common development tools
# (Git is usually included, but it's good practice to ensure utilities exist)
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y git curl zip unzip && \
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# 3. (Optional) Create a non-root user or configure permissions
# The 'gradle' image creates a 'gradle' user. VS Code handles this mapping automatically usually.

# 4. Set the working directory
WORKDIR /workspace

# 5. Do NOT copy source code here.
# Devcontainers automatically "mount" your local folder into /workspace.

# 6. Do NOT set an ENTRYPOINT.
# VS Code needs to override the entrypoint to keep the container running properly.
